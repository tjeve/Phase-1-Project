# Hungry Eyes: Search for Meals in your area by Picture!

The purpose of this project is to create a website that allows the user to search for a restaurant and its location based on images of food taken at that restaurant.  It utilizes the CSS framework Bootstrap, the CSS layout Masonry, and several API's including Yelp, Firebase and Google Maps. It is our second group project with Digital Crafts.
